gorunner
========

gorunner is an attempt to create a continuous integration web server written in golang.
As development occurs, I hope reusable code and interfaces develop since go is a
relatively new language.

Installation instructions
=========================

	$ cd $GOPATH/src
	$ go get github.com/jakecoffman/gorunner
	$ go run github.com/jakecoffman/gorunner/main.go
	
Or, you know, whatever works.
